## What/Why
I wanted to understand `zeromq` a little, so I play with it through its javascript binding here: https://github.com/fabienjuif/zeromq-js-tryout

Now I tried the same with Rust for reasons:
 - I want to learn Rust, so why not
 - I think the Rust version would be faster
 - I have this issue in the JS version, I hope this is not a bug in my design :) https://github.com/fabienjuif/zeromq-js-tryout/issues/1
